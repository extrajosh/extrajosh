<h5>Herbal Safety Guidelines
</h5>
<p>
    Before using an herb you are unfamiliar with, find out its medicinal properties. Research it thoroughly
    and/or consult with an appropriately qualified practitioner or expert. If you are taking prescription
    drugs, or have a medical condition, check with an appropriately qualified practitioner before using herbs
    medicinally. Herbs have shown overwhelming evidence that they work. Just because a small amount works well
    does NOT mean that more is better. As individuals we all have different constitutions, sensitivities,
    allergic reactions and possible health conditions. The following are merely guidelines. They include herbs
    offered on our websites. This list does not help with administering information on possible interactions
    and contraindications with prescription medicine. This needs to be discussed with your physician.
